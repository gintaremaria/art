Welcome to my online art gallery. My name is Gintare-Maria, and I am a portraitist, specializing in portraits of people and animals. I primarily paint with oil and gouache, but I am also skilled in and enjoy working with ink, watercolours, charcoal, acrylics, pencils, and the list goes on. The mediums I use to create art do not limit me in any way; no matter what kind of paint, canvas or a sheet of paper, I will breathe life into my painting and give it a character.

I focus most of my attention on the eyes, as they are the mirror of the soul â€“ the most expressive feature of the face. Through their shine and depth of gaze, I strive to convey the story of where this character came from, how they feel, and what they wish to communicate to their observers.

Painting is a way to express a story, emotion, and moment. In my artwork, I convey what I have seen and felt, as I am inspired by very different stages and events in my life.

I accept personal commissions that resonate with your visions and experiences. Feel free to reach out to me via email.
